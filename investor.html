<p>Investors have specific needs from their accountants and tax advisers.</p>
<p class="lead">Property</p>
<p>Buying or selling property can be complicated from a tax perspective. There is Income Tax, Capital Gains Tax, Goods and Services Tax, Land Tax, Stamp Duty plus anything else the government may impose. There is also Building Allowance and Depreciation to consider amongst the many deductions available to ensure you never pay too much tax.</p>
<p>Property investors need to consider more than just if the property is a good buy. Investors need to consider how the property will impact their existing portfolio and to ensure that the entire portfolio is maximising your after tax return.</p>
<p>Taking an holistic approach to your investments allows us to clarify if you can afford any new investment in a number of "what-if" scenarios. Let Michael and his team explain how negative gearing can be a powerful tool for creating future wealth.</p>
<p>We can then liaise with your bank or mortgage broker to ensure you receive the loan you need before you miss out on your investment.</p>
<p class="lead">Developers</p>
<p>Developing a property can be stressful enough. Running a business of property development can amplify those stresses without a solid business foundation.</p>
<p>Budgeting and forecasting are essential tools to ensuring your development is a financial success.</p>
<p>Bookkeeping is another essential part of running your business and we can assist by implementing the latest systems that makes doing the books <em>almost</em> enjoyable.</p>
<p class="lead">Home Owners</p>
<p>Owning your own home is what most of us dream for but achieving that goal can often be challenging enough. More than just keeping good personal finances and up to date tax returns, we can help you with personal budgeting to achieve your goals faster.</p>
